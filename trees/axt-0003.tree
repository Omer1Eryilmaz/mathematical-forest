\p{
  In the words of [Martín Escardó](martin-escardo): A \em{domain} is a set of
  concrete finite elements together with infinite, ideal elements such that the
  ideal elements are characterised uniquely by their finite approximations.
}

\p{
  There are different ways of capturing this mathematically, to varying degrees of
  precision. These include [continuous](axt-001T) and [algebraic](axt-001S) dcpos.
