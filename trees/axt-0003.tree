\p{
  In the words of [Martín Escardó](martinhescardo): A \em{domain} is a set of
  concrete finite elements together with infinite, ideal elements such that the
  ideal elements are characterised uniquely by their finite approximations.

\p{
  There are different ways of capturing this mathematically, to varying degrees
  of precision. These include [continuous](axt-0006A) and [algebraic](axt-0006B)
  dcpos.
